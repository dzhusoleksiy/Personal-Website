This portfolio was created using Webpack with the help of HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. Designed by me, its purpose is to showcase my projects and present myself as a skilled developer to potential employers. The portfolio brings together various essential links for convenient communication and provides a comprehensive display of my knowledge and skills, featuring detailed descriptions and a link to my CV.
